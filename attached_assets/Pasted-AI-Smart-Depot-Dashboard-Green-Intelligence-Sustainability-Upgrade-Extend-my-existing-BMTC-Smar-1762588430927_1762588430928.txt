AI Smart Depot Dashboard – Green Intelligence & Sustainability Upgrade

Extend my existing BMTC Smart Depot Dashboard by adding a full “🌱 Green Intelligence & Sustainability Section” below the current main metrics.
Keep the same yellow–white gradient theme, rounded cards, and modern minimal UI.

The section should feel AI-powered, data-rich, and visually aligned with the theme:

🧠 AI for a Sustainable Planet – Code That Saves Carbon

🌍 Section Title:

Sustainability Dashboard – Green Intelligence Stats

🌱 1. Core Sustainability Metrics (Top Row Cards)

Create four animated cards with smooth counters and icons:

Metric	Icon	Description	Extra Visual
Carbon Emission Saved (kg CO₂)	🌿	“Estimated CO₂ saved through optimized bus routes.”	Green progress bar (auto-updating)
Fuel Efficiency (L/100km)	⛽	“Saved X litres this week compared to baseline.”	Mini fuel gauge bar
Eco Score (0–100)	💚	“Environmental performance score based on emission, occupancy & idle time.”	Circular color-coded progress meter (red–yellow–green)
EV Readiness (%)	⚡	“Routes suitable for electric conversion.”	Horizontal progress bar

All values should auto-update with mock dynamic data every 5–10 seconds.

📈 2. Visualization Section (Below Cards)

Split into two halves:

Left: Line Chart – “Emission Reduction Trend (Last 7 Days)”

X-axis: Days

Y-axis: CO₂ saved (kg)

Smooth animation on data change.

Right: Bar Chart – “Fuel Optimization by Depot”

X-axis: Depot Names (mock: Depot 1–5)

Y-axis: Litres saved

Highlight current depot.

Charts refresh automatically with mock changes.

🤖 3. AI Insights Panel

Add 3–4 animated AI recommendation cards (scrollable or cycling):

Examples:

“Shift 2 diesel buses on Route 365J to EV — 1.3 kg CO₂/day saved.”

“Reduce 1 off-peak bus at Maharani College stop.”

“Depot 3 reached Eco Score 92 — Efficiency Level A.”

“Schedule preventive maintenance on high-idle Route 210E.”

Add a small 🤖 AI icon, soft fade-in transitions, and mock data rotation every 10s.

🧮 4. AI Forecast Box

A small card titled:

AI Prediction: Tomorrow’s CO₂ Emission
Show:

“Predicted: 890 kg CO₂ (↓ 5% from today)”

Include a small trend arrow ↑↓ and percentage change.

✅ Use random trending mock data for demo.

🧭 5. Smart Route Optimizer Panel

Add a small table with mock optimization data:

Route	Efficiency	CO₂ Saved	Suggestion
365J	92%	1.3 kg/day	Shift 1 diesel to EV
290B	81%	0.9 kg/day	Reduce 2 off-peak trips
210E	75%	0.5 kg/day	Adjust departure times

✅ Simple data table with green/yellow/red indicators for efficiency.

🔋 6. Depot Energy & EV Charging Tracker

Add a mini Energy Monitor card group:

⚡ Depot Power Usage: “230 kWh/day”

🔋 EV Charging Load: “90 kWh/day”

Include comparative icons: “↓10% this week”
Use animated bars or small donut charts.

⚠️ 7. AI Anomaly Detector

Show automatic alerts if mock data crosses thresholds:
Example:

“⚠️ High fuel usage on Route 210E — possible traffic congestion.”
“⚠️ CO₂ spike detected — optimization needed.”

✅ Animate alerts (blink or pulse softly).
✅ Automatically clear after 5 seconds.

🧩 8. City Impact Simulator

A futuristic panel showing city-level projection:

“If 5 depots adopt this system → 12 tons CO₂ saved per month.”
Add animated growing leaf icons 🌿 as visual impact.

🚌 9. Bus-Level Eco Data Table

Add expandable data table:

Bus No	Fuel Saved (L)	CO₂ Saved (kg)	Eco Rating
KA-57-F-1123	12	28	A
KA-57-G-9321	8	18	B
KA-57-H-2231	15	32	A+

✅ Auto-refresh every 15s with new mock data.

☀️ 10. Weather-Aware Insight Card

Display a small AI insight like:

“🌦 Rain expected tomorrow – predicted 3% lower fuel efficiency.”
✅ Randomize message between weather types (sunny/rainy).

💚 11. Passenger Comfort Index

Add card:

“Passenger Comfort Index: 8.6/10 — peak time crowd reduced by 21%.”
✅ Simulate value updates based on load.

🧾 12. AI Report Generator Button

Add a “🧾 Generate Weekly Report” button:
When clicked → show a summary box or exportable text:

“This week, Depot 3 saved 312L fuel, reduced 820 kg CO₂, achieved Eco Score 87 (Grade A), and EV Readiness: 63%.”

✅ Optional: Print or download as text/PDF.

🧠 13. AI Voice Query (Optional Enhancement)

Add a mic 🎙 button — when clicked, show example responses:

“Show today’s emission trend.”
“Display top eco-efficient route.”

(Simulate responses via UI triggers, no real speech recognition needed.)

🥇 14. Eco Leaderboard (Mock Data)

Add a comparative ranking card:

Depot	Eco Score	Rank
Depot 3	92	🥇
Depot 6	87	🥈
Depot 1	81	🥉

✅ Randomize or mock data.

🌐 15. Public Display Mode (Toggle Button)

Button → “Enable Public Mode”
When active: hide controls, show only top eco stats in large text.
Perfect for depot wall screens or public awareness.

🎨 UI / UX Requirements

Maintain yellow–white gradient and green accent colors (#4CAF50, #A8E063).

Use soft shadows, rounded cards, minimal typography.

Animate all metric numbers & chart updates smoothly.

Keep responsiveness for laptop & tablet screens.

Add subtle green glow hover effects on sustainability cards.

⚙️ Data & Updates

Use mock JSON arrays or random() functions for all live updates.

Refresh emission, fuel, eco score, and forecast values every 5–10 seconds.

Charts and tables should visually reflect updates.
