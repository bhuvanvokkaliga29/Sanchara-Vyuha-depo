xtend my existing BMTC Depot Dashboard by adding a new section called “🌱 Sustainability Dashboard” below the current main metrics section.

The design theme should perfectly match the existing style — use the same yellow–white gradient background, rounded cards, and minimalistic modern look.

✨ Section Title:

Sustainability Dashboard – Green Intelligence Stats

📊 Add These Four Main Metric Cards:

Carbon Emission Saved (kg CO₂)

Icon: 🌿

Shows: “Estimated CO₂ saved through optimized bus routes.”

Animated number counter (e.g., 1,245 kg).

Add a small green progress bar below it.

Fuel Efficiency (L/100km)

Icon: ⛽

Shows comparison between baseline and optimized values (e.g., “Saved 215 L this week”).

Add a small fuel gauge bar.

Eco Score (0–100)

Icon: 💚

Circular progress meter showing environmental performance.

Color-coded: 0–50 red, 51–80 yellow, 81–100 green.

EV Readiness (%)

Icon: ⚡

Progress bar showing how many routes are suitable for electric buses (mock data).

📈 Add Visualization Section Below Cards:

Left: Line Chart – Emission Reduction Trend (Last 7 Days)
(label X-axis: days, Y-axis: kg CO₂ saved)

Right: Bar Chart – Fuel Optimization by Depot
(each bar = depot, value = litres saved)

🧠 Add “AI Insights” Panel (to the right side or bottom):

Display 3–4 AI-generated sustainability tips in card format:

Example 1: “Shift 2 diesel buses on Route 365J to EV — 1.3 kg CO₂/day saved.”

Example 2: “Reduce 1 off-peak bus at Maharani College stop.”

Example 3: “Depot 3 reached Eco Score: 92 — Efficiency Level A.”

Use a small AI icon 🤖 and show these in animated card transitions.

🎨 Style Guidelines:

Keep UI consistent with the current dashboard.

Use green accents (#4CAF50 / #A8E063) to symbolize eco-friendliness.

Maintain soft shadows, rounded corners, and clean typography.

The entire section should fit naturally under the main dashboard metrics.

⚙️ Functionality (for demo/mock data):

Generate mock sustainability data dynamically (random or fixed).

Include realistic values for each metric.

Charts should update visually when data changes (mock updates every 5–10s).

This new Sustainability Dashboard section should make the project match the theme “AI for a Sustainable Planet — Code That Saves Carbon.”
The result should look professional, AI-driven, and data-rich — suitable for innovation or hackathon presentation.
